It is important to note, that this is the same season 2, which makes this show and season the most viewed by far! Additionally, Bridgerton Season 3 and Fool me once (limited series) are next in the ranking. Answering out question of interest, regarding shows, None of these shows are american, they are all international with the exception of Monsters (Menendez Brother’s story).\nConclusion: There is a big difference in consumption between TV Shows and Movies on Netflix. I would infer that Netflix has a stronger marketing strategy for their own produced movies, and are widely consumed, as they are advertised strongly by the platform.\nConnection to class: I used the lolly plot, as this is more effective than using a bar plot for these types of quantitative & categorical variables. We are starting the scale at zero, so none of our results are misleading anyone, and we can see the actual overall trend of the views."
