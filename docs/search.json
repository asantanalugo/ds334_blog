There is no data to compare it to, but the feel from the last years is that there was an ‘overpopulation’ of international students, virtually no student athletes, and very little Greek Life representation. In this senate, the 6 chapters of Greek Life on campus are represented (about 20% of the senate is part of Greek Life), and, combined, more than 50% of the senate is part of a sport organization. The percentage of international students is almost exactly proportional to the real percentage of international students on campus, this senate has 11%, and SLU has 12%.\nIt is important to note that this does not include the Executive Board, thus, excluding 6 students from the sample size. Considering that 4 out of the 6 Executive Board members are international students, this metric would be higher if they were to be included.\nConclusion: Personally, I think this is a successful first step at accurately building a body represented of the student body. There biggest area of growth I can identify, is the difference between class years, as First Years and Sophomores are the most represented, which makes sense because of shifting time commitments and class difficulty as a students’ major progresses.\nConnect to Class: I connect this a lot to the idea of how useful or accurate are barcharts for representing data. In this case, it is only looking at counts and percentages, and it is what I found to be the most accurate when representing it. Although, hopefully in a couple of years when the next Exec Board had more data, they can start plotting other graphs, to look at historical trends, and not only barcharts. Because these are only counts, I found that they were okay to use."
