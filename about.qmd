My name is Alexa, I'm currently a Junior at St. Lawrence University majoring in Statistics & Economics. This blog is part of my Data Visualization class, in which I am exploring different data sets of personal interest, and ways to visualize them!

I am interested in behavioral economics, which is why I choose the Netflix consumption data set. I am also interested in using R for data visualization that is accessible to people without a Stats background. This motivated me to explore the data set from our own student government, for which I produced graphs that were shared with University Staff and a wide range of students.
