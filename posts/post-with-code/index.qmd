## Thelmo Reports (Blog Post #2):

This data set was taken from a Thelmo Society meeting a month ago. The goal of the survey was the start a precedent of institutional data with the organization in hopes of building inclusive Senate bodies and hold other EBoard accountable.

## Overall Involvement by Position

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
thelmo <- read_csv("thelmo.csv")

thelmo_df <- thelmo |> 
  select(-5, -7, -9, -11, -13, -15, -17, -19, -21, -23)

thelmo_df <- rename(thelmo_df,
                    sportsteam = sportsteam...4,
                    sportsclub = sportsclub...6, 
                    greek = greek...8, 
                    admissions = admissions...10, 
                    ocip = ocip...12, 
                    work = work...14, 
                    theme = theme...16, 
                    eboard = eboard...18, 
                    none = none...20, 
                    saac = saac...22)


cat_thelmo_df <- 
thelmo_df |> group_by(position) |>
  summarise(sportsteam = sum(sportsteam), 
            sportsclub = sum(sportsclub), 
            greek = sum(greek), 
            admissions = sum(admissions), 
            ocip = sum(ocip), 
            work = sum(work), 
            theme = sum(theme), 
            eboard = sum(eboard), 
            none = sum(none))
```

## Overall Involvement

```{r}
cat_thelmo_df_long <-
cat_thelmo_df |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c(sportsteam, sportsteam, sportsclub, greek, admissions, 
                        ocip, work, theme, eboard, none),
               names_to = "involved", 
               values_to = "count")


total_involvement <-

            theme = sum(theme), 
            eboard = sum(eboard), 
            none = sum(none)) 
```

## Involvement (Percentage)

```{r}
percentage_involvement <-

  ungroup() |> 
  summarise(sportsteam = ((sum(sportsteam) / 53) * 100), 
            sportsclub = ((sum(sportsclub) / 53) * 100), 
            greek = ((sum(greek) / 53) * 100), 
            admissions = ((sum(admissions) / 53) * 100), 
            ocip = ((sum(ocip) / 53) * 100), 
            work = ((sum(work) / 53) * 100), 
            theme = ((sum(theme) / 53) * 100), 
            eboard = ((sum(eboard) / 53) * 100), 
            none = ((sum(none) / 53) * 100))

```

## Visualization of Involvement

```{r}
ggplot(data = cat_thelmo_df_long, aes(x = position, y = count, fill = position)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap(~ involved) + 
  labs(title = "Senate Involvement (Spring '26)", 
       y = "Number of Students", x = "Position in the Senate") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 17),
    breaks = 1:17) +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(face = "bold")) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
  "Chair"   = "#653A2B",
  "ClubRep" = "#AA182C",
  "Senator" = "#D5BA8C"))
```

```{r}
## Tables

# Fix pivot_longer
cat_thelmo_df_long <-
  cat_thelmo_df |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(sportsteam, sportsclub, greek, admissions, ocip, work, 
             theme, eboard, none),
    names_to = "involved",
    values_to = "count")
```

## Students Status:

```{r}
## international students: 

thelmo_ints <- 
  thelmo_df |> group_by(status) |> 
  count(status) |> 
  ungroup() |>
  mutate(percen_status = (n / 53) * 100) |> 
  slice(1:2)
  

ggplot(data = thelmo_ints, aes(x = status, y = percen_status)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "#AA182C") + 
  labs(y = "Percentage of Senate", x = "Status", 
       title = "Student Status (Spring '26)") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 90), breaks = seq(0, 90, by = 10))
  
```

## Class Year Distribution:

```{r}
thelmo_class_year <- 
  thelmo_df |> group_by(gradyear) |> 
  count(gradyear) |> 
  mutate(percen_classyear = (n / 53) * 100)

ggplot(data = thelmo_class_year, aes(x = gradyear, y = percen_classyear)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "#AA182C") + 
  labs(y = "Percentage of Senate", x = "Class Year", 
       title = "Student Class Year (Spring '26)") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 40), breaks = seq(0, 40, by = 5))

```
