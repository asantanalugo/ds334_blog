## Blog Post #2:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

airlines_df <- read_csv(here("week19_airline_safety.csv"))

airlines_df |> group_by(type_of_event) |> 
  arrange(desc(n_events))

airlines_df |> group_by(type_of_event) |> 
  arrange(desc(avail_seat_km_per_week)) |> 
  print(n = 40)

## take n_events to avail_seat_km_per_week ratio? something like that?? that can help see relationship between how much do planes travel vs. how much many events they've had
```
