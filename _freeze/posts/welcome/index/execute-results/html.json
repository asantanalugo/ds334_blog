According to Tidy Tuesday, Netflix releases Engagement Reports which breakdown the amount of hours users have spent watching both Movies & TV Shows. In this blog post we will look at trying to visualize what are the most watched movies and TV shows in each report, and try to identify if the most watched shows / movies are american, or international!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## loading in packages: \nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages

2025, with about 313 million hours viewed. The next is Leave the World Behind with about 286 million hours viewed. What I find the most interesting of these 10 most watched movies, is that they are all originally produced movies by Netflix, and most of them are american movies.\n\nFor shows: The most watched show is Squid Game, with more than 840 million hours views from January to June 2025, nonetheless, it also re-appears in the list, as the number 6th most viewed from July to December 2024 with 216 million hours views. It is important to note, that this is the same season 2, which makes this show and season the most viewed by far! Additionally, Bridgerton Season 3 and Fool me once (limited series) are next in the ranking. Answering out question of interest, regarding shows, None of these shows are american, they are all international with the exception of Monsters (Menendez Brother's story).\n\nConclusion: There is a big difference in consumption between TV Shows and Movies on Netflix. I would infer that Netflix has a stronger marketing strategy for their own produced movies, and are widely consumed, as they are advertised strongly by the platform.\n\nConnection to class: I used the lolly plot, as this is more effective than using a bar plot for these types of quantitative & categorical variables. We are starting the scale at zero, so none of our results are misleading anyone, and we can see the actual overall trend of the views.\n",
